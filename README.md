# Generative-AI-for-Producing-Detailed-Maps-from-Aerial-Imagery
This project uses Pix2Pix cGAN to convert satellite images into high-resolution maps for urban planning, disaster management, and environmental monitoring. Model performance will be evaluated using SSIM and pixel-wise accuracy on datasets like DeepGlobe and SpaceNet.
